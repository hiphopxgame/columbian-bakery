                In the heart of Colombia, where the Andes meet the Caribbean breeze, families have gathered 
                for centuries around the simple pleasure of fresh-baked goods. The Bombshell represents more 
                than just a pastry ‚Äì it's a celebration of cultural identity, a bridge between past and present.

                Our founder's journey from Colombian kitchens to Portland's vibrant food scene represents 
                the beautiful tapestry of immigration and cultural exchange. Each Bombshell we create honors 
                the traditions while embracing innovation, ensuring that these cherished flavors continue 
                to bring people together, one bite at a time.
